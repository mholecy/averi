# 10. The pixel assert judges the soft keyboard first, with K1's reading outside standing

Status: accepted, 2026-10-12 (owner).

## Context

Measured on an API 33 emulator: a tap on a field raised the IME over the bottom ~40 % of a payment form. uiautomator
went on reporting the pinned CONTINUE at its at-rest rect, because the keyboard is a separate window. A colour assert
sampled the key faces (`#FFFFFF`), and an ocr assert read the `?123` key ("123"). Each was reported as the element's. Had
the expected value been the keyboard's colour, the assert would have passed on an element nobody can see.

When the pixel assert moved onto standing, the keyboard could have joined the bands and covers in standing's one order.
It could also have stayed ahead of them, where the old round put it.

## Decision

- **Keyboard first.** The order is the keyboard, then the system bands, then cut, then covered. The keyboard's remedy
  (hide it) is no scroll, so it is said first.
- **K1's reading stays outside standing.** The pixel poll asks the reading (`ui-tree/keyboard-cover.ts#readKeyboard`)
  `overlapping` itself, before standing. That reading covers Android's window, WDA's in-tree band and floating panels.
  It never asks the witness, which exists to veto a key press, and nothing is pressed here.
- **Only idb's band is a standing region** (ADR 0006). A panel's rect is no `KeyboardLine`.
- **Any overlap counts** (`rectsOverlap`): the ocr assert crops the whole rect. The colour sampler insets 12 %, so a
  keyboard under only the bottom edge fails closed where colour could have measured. That cost is accepted to keep one
  rule. An edge that only touches is not covered.
- **The miss continues the poll.** The round is a fail-closed miss that quotes both rects and captures nothing. The poll
  goes on, so a keyboard that leaves before the deadline costs a round, not the verdict.

## Residuals accepted

- When the reading cannot see the keyboard, the old behaviour returns silently. Examples: a floating or split IME that
  supplies no insets frame, and the transient read right after the focus tap.
- The API 34+ `type=ime` line comes from AOSP and has not been captured on a device.
- A multi-display device reads unknown.
- A stale `shown` costs covered rounds until the window state catches up. Under a short timeout it fails closed with the
  covered wording, never a false pass.
