# 46. The iOS tree source is WebDriverAgent when it comes up

Status: accepted 2026-11-12 (performance backlog rows A41, decided by the owner, and A41a,
docs/plans/2026-10-30-performance-backlog.md). Golden unchanged: every recording pins its source. The next Gate C
checks the default block (see Acceptance).

## Context

- Under idb, on scroll-bounded and scroll-bounded-footer, averi says Tapped (S sliver, O outside the scroll view,
  footer O) while the app logged nothing. That is a false success claim. ADR 0010 accepted it as residual 5 because
  idb lists no scroll-view clip. idb also lists no presented layer under blur-menu-stacked/-grouped (A38). A38
  recorded what is left as KNOWN, with the same way out every time: `treeSource: wda`.
- The golden's unsafe residue is idb 42 against WDA 6.
- Closing the gap on idb alone would need a screenshot check per idb tap (rejected on cost in ADR 0010), or a hybrid
  that reads both trees and cross-checks them. The hybrid was rejected: it reconciles two trees, and the signals are
  incomplete either way.
- The reason idb was the default was cost: the server instructions said WDA was "~2x slower". On the lab that is no
  longer true for warm use. Warm WDA reads and taps are no slower than idb's (A41's D0 table). Gate C on 2026-11-12
  took 1 707 s on WDA against 1 869 s on idb.
- WDA's remaining costs are its cold start (3–23 s on the first read), fill +0.7 s, ensure cold +2.7 s, and the need
  for Xcode and the `appium-webdriveragent` optional dependency.

## Decision

**`app.ios.treeSource` takes `auto`, `idb` or `wda`, and `auto` is the default. Under `auto` the adapter's first tree
read asks WebDriverAgent to come up. If it does, every call is WDA's for the adapter's life. If it does not, every
read is idb's for the adapter's life, and every reply that claims what it read carries one `⚠` line saying so.**

- ONE source per adapter (ADR 0032): `auto` picks one and never reconciles two trees. A later WDA failure is WDA's
  error, as under `treeSource: wda`, never a switch to idb.
- "Can be brought up" is `WdaTreeSource.bringUp`, which is `WdaServer.ensureRunning` within its own bounds: the
  package is present, the first build succeeds, and /status answers within its readiness bound. It is decided once,
  lazily, at the first tree read, and kept. There is no probe at startup or at `launch_app`. Pre-warming is A41b.
- The fallback is said twice. averi's stderr gets one line with WDA's whole error. Each claiming reply gets
  `⚠ read through idb: WebDriverAgent did not come up (<reason>; select_device again to retry) and idb lists no
  presented layer or scroll clip — a layer over the target or a clip cutting it was not judged`
  (`adapters/auto-tree-source.ts#idbFallbackNote`, carried by `DeviceAdapter.claimNote`). `<reason>` is the first
  clause of WDA's error, at most 80 characters (`fallbackReason`): `WebDriverAgent requires the appium-webdriveragent
  package`, `A WebDriverAgent answers /status on port 8100`, `WDA build failed`. The agent cannot read averi's stderr,
  so the reason travels in the reply. The claiming replies are `tap` with a selector, `type_text` with a selector (a
  fill), `scroll_until`, `assert`, `run_flow`, `ensure_state` and `verify` (`mcp/tools.ts#noted`). The engine tools
  also put it on the error they throw: a failed flow's error lists the ✓ lines of the taps and fills before the step
  that failed. Any other refusal claims nothing and gets no note. Nothing is refused for the fallback.
- The retry is `select_device` of the same simulator. `registry.ts#select` drops a cached adapter whose `claimNote` is
  set, so the next call builds a fresh `auto` adapter that asks WDA again. A re-select keeps every other adapter, as
  before.
- With the package missing, `WdaServer` now says so before the "first WDA build … takes minutes" line, not after it,
  and its refusal opens `WebDriverAgent requires the appium-webdriveragent package` (it opened `treeSource: wda
  requires`, which named a setting the `auto` user never wrote).
- Before the choice, what is asked without a tree read is idb's. The launch's application label comes from idb, as
  it did under the old default; WDA would answer `declined`, since it is not up. `kind` reads `idb` for the label's
  wording, and there is no settle cadence (the default 500). After the choice, `kind`, the settle cadence
  (ADR 0040), the system alert and the label are the chosen source's.
- Typing follows the choice (ADR 0037). `IosAdapter.typeable` is asked of the source per call. It is WDA_TYPEABLE
  until a fallback, and IDB_TYPEABLE after one, so a later value idb cannot type is refused before anything is sent.
  - A fill checks the value twice: before resolving the field, as always, and again after the resolution's read,
    before the focus tap (`interact/fill.ts#fillField`). If that read was the one that fell back, a value only WDA
    types is refused there with ADR 0037's refusal: nothing tapped, cleared or typed.
  - A text that needs WDA, typed before any read (`type_text` without a selector, a flow's `type:`), makes the choice
    itself. If WDA does not come up, it is refused as idb refuses it, with WDA's reason after it. Nothing is typed.
  - `IosAdapter.typeText` is the backstop: a text only WDA types, reaching it over a source with no typer, gets the
    same refusal instead of idb's trace. Every caller checks `typeable` first, so under `treeSource: idb` this cannot
    be reached, and that setting is unchanged.
- `treeSource: idb` and `treeSource: wda` behave as before, byte for byte. The registry caches per setting, so
  `auto`, `idb` and `wda` are three adapters.
- `app.ios.keyboardDismiss`'s load-time note (`flow/config.ts#inertKeyboardDismissNote`) is printed only for a
  project that pins `idb`. Under `auto` the list applies whenever WDA comes up.

## Residuals

1. Under a fallback, idb's blind spots stay: the false Tapped of ADR 0010 residual 5, and the presented layers A38
   left KNOWN. They are now said on the reply instead of hidden. A41c's hit test is the planned guard.
2. The first read of an `auto` adapter pays WDA's cold start: 3–23 s warm-built, minutes for the first build per
   Xcode. The worst case is a fresh machine. There the first read can block for more than 10 minutes before it
   either reads through WDA or falls back: the build's bound is 600 s, and the readiness bound (60 s for /status)
   comes after it. Pre-warming WDA at `select_device` / `launch_app` is A41b's.
3. A fallback leaves `app.ios.keyboardDismiss` inert without a load-time note, because the config cannot know the
   choice. The claim note does not name the keyboard.
4. After a fallback, a value only WDA types is refused before anything is sent: by the fill's second check, or by
   `type_text`'s own check. That refusal is ADR 0037's idb wording, and its remedy names `treeSource: wda`, which fails
   on this machine for the reason the note gives. The remedy is to fix that reason, then `select_device` again.
5. Two adapters of one simulator, `auto` and `wda` (two projects, one server), each own a WdaServer on the same
   per-UDID port. That is the D41 situation of ADR 0032, unchanged.

## Acceptance

Golden Changed 0, because golden pins its source. Unit tests cover the choice, its caching, the fallback note and
typing. At the next Gate C (owner): the default block has ≤ 6 known unsafe, and its wall time is ≤ the idb block
+ 10 %.
